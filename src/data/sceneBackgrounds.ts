/** Tortuga's dockside tavern at dusk — the Black Pearl moored at the pier, "TAVERN" signboard lit,
 * castle silhouette across the water. Portrait-oriented (853x1844, ~0.46 aspect), close to a phone
 * screen's own proportions, so it reads as a real backdrop rather than a stretched/cropped square
 * illustration. First background art provided for ConversationBox — wired into the Debug screen's
 * "Conversation Box Preview" so Scally's tavern lines finally have the tavern behind them, matching
 * the original mockup this component was built from. */

/** Tortuga Cove's harbor square at midday — market stalls, the Black Pearl at the pier, a busy
 * bustling hometown feel, contrasting the dusk/quiet tavern piece above. First delivery from
 * CONVERSATION_BACKGROUNDS_BRIEF.md's scene #1 (`tortuga_market_day_1`). Matches the brief's
 * 853x1844 canvas exactly, no resize needed. Note for future deliveries: the brief's composition
 * rule (keep the bottom ~35-40% simple, since that's where the parchment/portrait overlay sits) is
 * only loosely followed here — there's a fruit cart, barrels, and crates well into the lower third
 * — but it still reads fine in practice since none of that detail is bright/high-contrast enough to
 * fight the parchment for attention; see the item 122 GAME_DESIGN.md note for the actual in-app
 * check before deciding whether to send this one back for a redo. */
